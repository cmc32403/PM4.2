For our project, we created "Task Buddy, a user-friendly platform to help people organize their responsibilities and tasks. Within Task Buddy, users can add various tasks with a description, deadline, and option for a reminder. In addition, users can "rank" their tasks from most important to least important and "check off" the task once complete. Task Buddy was developed using agile development, unit testing, and CI/CD which enabled our team to effectively and efficiently contribute to the project.
